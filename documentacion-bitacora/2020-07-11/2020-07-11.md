### end: 

## TODO:
- [x] Get data from the datepicker.
- [x] visualize the changes in a gridview
- [ ] Visualize the json files as a gridView inside a modal.
- [ ] Create the admin panel and implementation.
- [ ] All admin related sps. 

## notes:

Getting the dreaded datepickers took me 3 hours to get working. I had problems with the css, page layout(getting under navbar), and textbox type. 

Bind things to the gridview and then declare them as hidden or the data wont persist.

1 hour debugging the shitty getJson stored procedure.

Null problems: cant use ? operator cuz i need to upgrade the c# version from 7.3 to 8.0
